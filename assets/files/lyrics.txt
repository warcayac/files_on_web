あしたはいい日になる
Tomorrow Will be a Better Day

Lyrics:Aoki Kumiko
Composition:Kiyooka Chiho
Arrangement:Yano Tatsumi
Vocals: Satou Akemi

Through a forest of thorns, we've come walking.
For the rose to which our hearts seek.
Protect the love which lives nobly,
and cultivate the dreams of fleeting flowers.
"Tomorrow Will Be a Better day", I whisper many times,
And rain upon you, today's last prayer.
On the night when even sorrows sleep,
I'll be a fire by your side.
Within a seed's wish, give strength
Until the day tears become a rainbow.
"Tomorrow will be a better day", my heart prays,
Loving the time we are with each other.
May all livings things be happy.
